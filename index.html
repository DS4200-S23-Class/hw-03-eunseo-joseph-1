                    <ul>
                        <li>Represents attribute of visual popout</li>
                        <li>This is a good mapping because the distinct color differences in red vs. blue on the map as well as the distinct color standout
                        on the battleground state (half red/half blue) makes the graph easy to analyze. However, the focus of the visual is not necessarily 
                            intended to be the swing state.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Represents attribute of accuracy</li>
                        <li>This is an okay mapping, because state shapes are represented accurately according to scale. Having the states represented by their outlines
                            also helps with comprehension of data, as someone does not have to squint at tiny text to decipher which state they are looking at.
                            However, the size of a state does not necessarily correlate with the number of electoral votes they have and the impact they 
                            have on the overall electoral college.
                        </li>

                        <li>Represents attribute of accuracy</li>
                        <li>The shape created by the electoral votes needed to win bar helps voters understand
                            how close the election would be. The bar is easy to read and shows the accurate belief that the blue
                            states would win by a large margin. 
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Represents attribute of popout</li>
                        <li>This is an good mapping, because the bold colors and the contrast of red (not a lot) vs blue (a lot)
                        accomplishes the main point of the visualization. These colors are also semantically meaningful with
                        the U.S.'s party colors. However, if the map wanted to go into more depth about how truly Democratic
                        or Republican each state was, they could've more fully utilized the divergent scheme to show states
                        that were closer to swing than others. </li>

                        <li>This is a good mapping, because the position + hue are fully separable. A user is able to understand both the relationship
                        between launch angle and exit velocity represented by position, as well as scoring value represented by hue.</li>

                        <li>Represents attribute of discriminality</li>
                        <li>This is a bad mapping in our opinion because the colors do not lie on a scale gradient or a temperature gradient.
                        The purple and orange create some contrast, but it is hard to apply the colors to the information depicted.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Represents attribute of grouping</li>
                        <li>This is a good mapping in our opinion because the horizontal lines representing pop ups, line drives, fly balls,
                        and ground balls separate all the batted balls into categories that make the visual easier to understand. 
                        ALmost everyone knows what these types of balls are and what they usually look like, so it helps add context
                        to the visualization. </li>

                        <li>This is a bad mapping, because the colors may diverge but are not effective in this context.
                        The colors are supposed to depict how above or below average a scoring value is, but feel unintuitive. 
                        Also, accessibility is a concern in this, as people may not be able to decipher the difference between
                        the aveage 'cream' and the grey background and assume there is no data there.</li>

                        <li>This is a good mapping, because it is easy to see which phrases are most commonly said and that there is one phrase that 
                        very obviously sticks out.</li>

                        <li>This is a bad mapping, because there are too many movies to be efficiently represented by colors.
                        The key features 14 different movies that are each assigned a random color, and it is hard to tell what
                        the color represents because it is completely arbitrary. It just makes the graph more confusing. Maybe if 
                        the colors were grouped together it would work better to show how many top bigrams each movie had, but it is not helpful
                        the way it is currently structured.</li>

                        <li>This is a good mapping because the way the two sides of the graph are set up make it easy to look at the name and quantity
                        of bigrams. However, the issue with color (hue) negatively affects the position as well.</li>

                        <li>This is a good mapping, because it allows users to look at the channels independently.
                        For example, someone can just look at the line lengths and observe popularity, or look only
                        at the colors and know which color represents which category. However, the amount of colors
                        needed for this dataset may be overwhelming, and color may not be the most effective tool. </li>
