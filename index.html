                        <li>Represents attribute of visual popout</li>
                        <li>This is a good mapping because the distinct color differences in red vs. blue on the map as well as the distinct color standout
                        on the battleground state (half red/half blue) makes the graph easy to analyze. However, the focus of the visual is not necessarily 
                            intended to be the swing state.</li>

                        <li>This is an okay mapping, because state shapes are represented accurately according to scale. However, the size of a state does not
                        necessarily correlate with the number of electoral votes they have and the impact they have on the overall electoral college.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Represents attribute of separability</li>
                        <li>This is a good mapping, because the position + hue are fully separable. A user is able to understand both the relationship
                        between launch angle and exit velocity represented by position, as well as scoring value represented by hue.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Represents attribute of discriminality</li>
                        <li>This is a bad mapping in our opinion because the colors do not lie on a scale gradient or a temperature gradient.
                        The purple and orange create some contrast, but it is hard to apply the colors to the information depicted.</li>

                <li>Position - Horizontal 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Represents attribute of grouping</li>
                        <li>This is a good mapping in our opinion because the horizontal lines representing pop ups, line drives, fly balls,
                        and ground balls separate all the batted balls into categories that make the visual easier to understand. 
                        ALmost everyone knows what these types of balls are and what they usually look like, so it helps add context
                        to the visualization. </li>

                        <li>This is a good mapping, because it is easy to see which phrases are most commonly said and that there is one phrase that 
                        very obviously sticks out.</li>

                        <li>This is a bad mapping, because there are too many movies to be efficiently represented by colors.
                        The key features 14 different movies that are each assigned a random color, and it is hard to tell what
                        the color represents because it is completely arbitrary. It just makes the graph more confusing. Maybe if 
                        the colors were grouped together it would work better to show how many top bigrams each movie had, but it is not helpful
                        the way it is currently structured.</li>

                        <li>Represents attribute of accuracy</li>
                        <li>This is a good mapping because the way the two sides of the graph are set up make it easy to look at the name and quantity
                        of bigrams. However, the issue with color (hue) negatively affects the position as well.</li>
